# ReAct Agent Architecture + Memory Saver Using LangGraph

The **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** agent architecture combines the power of **LLMs and tools** in a **looping graph structure** using LangGraph. It allows the agent to think, decide when tools are needed, use them, and reason further based on the results.

## Key Components

* **LLM Node**: Thinks and decides what action to take (e.g., call a tool or respond directly).
* **Tool Node**: Executes specific tools (search, calculator, APIs) based on the LLM's decisions.
* **Graph Flow**: After using a tool, control goes back to the LLM, enabling multi-step reasoning.
* **Conditional Logic**: LLM output is checked—if a tool is needed, it routes to the tool node.

## ReAct Loop

1. **LLM thinks** →
2. **Calls a tool** if needed →
3. **Gets tool result** →
4. **Thinks again** →
5. **Repeats or replies**.

This back-and-forth continues until a final response is ready.

## With Memory

* Threaded memory helps the agent **remember past results**.
* Enables **follow-up questions** and **contextual understanding**.

##  Why It’s Powerful

* Combines **reasoning + action** in one flow.
* Handles **complex multi-step tasks**.
* Easy to extend with new tools.
* Useful for real-world agents like **chatbots, assistants, and data bots**.
